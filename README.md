# Adjust Jupyter notebooks from fast.ai course to run on free clouds
The purpose of creating this repository is to enable to run every Jupyter notebook lesson from the fast.ai course on free clouds such as Google Colaboratory and Kaggle.

## Google Colaboratory
Jupyter notebooks are corrected and tested to run on Google Colaboratory. You can run them by selecting this Githib page and sub folder "Google Colaboratory" from the Open dialog at https://colab.research.google.com/

## Current Status
This is a work in progress. The plan is to update all Jupyter notebook lessons in place.
